# Inspiration
Citizen's currently have no mechanism to figure out how their electrical power consumption is distributed amongst the different devices. Due to this constraint, citizens don't have the ability to align their power usage.

# What it does
Bijli helps the average citizen to monitor power usage - the necessary first step towards better aligning power usage.

Phantom power usage could make to 10% of total electrical usage in an average household. These "phantom" loads occur in most appliances that use electricity, such as TVs, chargers kitchen appliances, etc when they are not in use.

With bijli you can see your power consumption in real time as well as see your consumption history over period of time for your each device or room where ever you have connected the bijli.

# How I built it
We used current sensor which send data over cloud server using wifi. And from server we use data mining technology and easy to use interface to analyze the data. We will also create applications for most popular platforms like Android, Web, Windows phone and iPhone.

# Challenges I ran into
The major challenge was the cost reduction by selecting the low cost but precise hardware sensors.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Bijli can reduce cost of electricity by 15% to 20% on average.
There is nothing impossible.

What's next for Bijli Pe Nazar
We will convert our POC to working solution.
